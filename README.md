# Architecture used -

Frontend - ReactJS. Backend - Ruby on Rails.

The reason for choosing Rails and React for this application was simply because
when coded together, the development gets faster with React and rails
application. Rails framework provides the easy going solutions for any query
that is easy to read and write, and React helps in maintaining the front end
with lesser code format and is also great at displaying the data in small
chunks. There are many ways of building APIs. This creates the most convenient
method of development that increases the speed of app development.
